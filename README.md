# Serverless Workshop

*This is a shortened version of the [Openwhisk Bootcamp](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/openwhisk-workshops/tree/master/bootcamp). If you finish early or would like to explore more in your own time try some of the exercises from there.*

Welcome to the Serverless Workshop featuring [Apache Openwhisk](http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/).

This workshop will teach you how to develop serverless applications, composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions, using an open-source serverless platform.

By the end of the workshop you should be set up with a development environment and learnt how to create and invoke actions, work with parameters and logs and optionally learnt how to use and publish packages.
